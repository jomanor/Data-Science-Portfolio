In this project I have used survival analysis to study how the likelihood of the customer churn changes over time. I have also implementd a Random Forest model to predict the customer churn and deployed a model using flask webapp on Heroku.

## Micro Projects
- ### Statistics and Machine Learning
    - [Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/archd3sai/Statistical-Methods/blob/master/genetic-algorithm.ipynb) : In this file, I have implemented simple genetic algorithm network using forward propogation, backword propogation and optimization functions to predict the customer churn.
 
- ### Challenges
    - [SQL Challenges](https://github.com/archd3sai/SQL): This repository contains codes of online SQL challenges (From Hackerrank, Leetcode, Testdome, etc.) solved by me.
